Example 16: Reactive Atomic Components

This example demonstrates how to create components that combine:
- Atomic Design (visual structure)
- Flet-ASP reactive state (automatic updates)

Instead of creating visual atoms separately and then binding them to state,
these components come with reactive state built-in!

Key Concepts:
- ReactiveAtom base class for all reactive components
- Encapsulated state management within components
- Automatic binding and updates
- Reusable components with their own state lifecycle
