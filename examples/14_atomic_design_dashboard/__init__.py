Example 14: Atomic Design System Dashboard

This example demonstrates how to build a complete design system using
the Atomic Design methodology with flet-asp for state management.

Structure:
- atoms/: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, labels, icons)
- molecules/: Simple combinations (form fields, stat cards, menu items)
- organisms/: Complex components (sidebar, top bar, data table)
- templates/: Page layouts (dashboard template)
- pages/: Complete screens (analytics page, settings page)

The design system is fully reactive using flet-asp atoms for state management,
demonstrating how Atomic Design principles work seamlessly with reactive state.
