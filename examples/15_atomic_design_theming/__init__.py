Example 15: Atomic Design with Dynamic Theming

This example demonstrates how to build a theme-aware component library
using Atomic Design principles and flet-asp for reactive theme switching.

Key Concepts:
- Theme tokens (colors, typography, spacing) as atoms
- Theme-aware components that adapt to light/dark modes
- Real-time theme switching with flet-asp state management
- Reusable design system that scales across applications

This is an advanced example showing how professional design systems
handle theming, accessibility, and component composition.
